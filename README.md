# STAT3006 Assignment 1: Writing task based on Breiman's famous paper "The Two Cultures"(Machine Learning vs Statistics)

## In this assignment, I give my response to some questions regarding Breiman's paper. The main theme here is the ML vs statistics modelling approach.

### Goal of the assignment:

"This assignment is partly to expose you to the contrasting perspectives of what could be
termed statistical and machine learning approaches. It is also to encourage you to respond to
the arguments raised by Breiman, Efron and other discussants by developing your views
about the disciplines of statistics and machine learning, producing arguments and
communicating those persuasively.

Parts of this assignment comprise critical review. To me, being critical means: look for faults
with points and arguments and make these clear. Additionally, give credit for what you see as
valid points and arguments, at least if these are important. Also, form your own opinions,
develop logical and evidenced arguments to back these and communicate them clearly in
response to the issues raised. You need to decide whether you agree or disagree with Breiman
or hold another position on each key issue."
